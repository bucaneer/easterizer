### [Easterizer](https://bucaneer.github.io/easterizer) turns any date into a moveable feast like Easter

The date of Easter is defined as "the first Sunday after the first Full Moon following the March Equinox". This tool describes any given date using the template of "the {*x*}th {*weekday*} after the {*y*}th {*lunar phase*} following the {*solar event*}", and then calculates a list of dates in other years when that rule is observed.

All dates are given using the ([proleptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar)) Gregorian calendar and Universal Time.

Note: the dates calculated here for "the first Sunday after the first Full Moon following the March Equinox" are the dates of [Astronomical Easter](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/easter/easter_text3a.htm), which are sometimes different from the dates of actual Easter as calculated by traditional approximations.
